v. 0.97.2
   PS 08052015
   -- Added a new procedure utils.c::int getnumlevels(char fname[], char
      varname[]) and use it in H_surf_standard() to test whether the model file
      has been stripped to contain the surface layer only or not. (This is
      necessary when the top layer is not k = 0.)
   -- Added a few assertions to readfield() and writefield().
v. 0.97.1
   PS 06052015
   -- Added parameter `hastosucceed' to model_getvarid().
v. 0.97
   PS 05052015
   -- Set quit function for gridutils to enkf_quit. This change requires
      upgrade to the latest version of libgu (v. 0.54).
v. 0.96.3
   PS 05052015
   -- Fixed a defect in gridprm.c that sometimes caused exiting with error
      "VTYPE specified twice".
v. 0.96.2
   -- Cosmetic changes.
v. 0.96.1
   PS 19022015
   -- Fixed name of the "nk" dimension in pointlog files, get_nkname().
v. 0.96
   PS 17022015
   -- Fixed the call to grid_create() in model.c to pass correctly the grid type
      to the grid structure (was defaulted to GRIDVTYPE_Z). (Thanks to Paul
      Sandery for the bug report.)
v. 0.95
   PS 12022015
   -- Modified code to be able to proceed with nobs = 0; introduced a new option
      for enkf_calc "--ignore-no-obs".
v. 0.94
   PS 05022015
   -- Added code for qsort_r() activated by compiler flag -DNO_QSORT_R. (For
      systems with old glibc; based on public code sort_r.h by Isaac Turner.)
v. 0.93
   Paul Sandery 30012015
   -- Added a reader for AMSR-2.
v. 0.92.3
   PS 30012015
   -- Corrected das_updatebg() to work in the case STRIDE = 1 (thanks to Paul
      Sandery for the bug report).
v. 0.92.2
   PS 16012015
   -- Modified H_surf_standard() and H_surf_biased() to read the actual level
      of the surface variable.
v. 0.92.1
   PS 16012015
   -- Made DEPTHVARNAME optional for a grid; an error is generated in
      model_getdepth() if it is not set for the grid the variable is defined on.
   -- Made the inflation limited by half of the magnitude of the spread
      reduction.
v. 0.92
   PS 06012015
   -- Added a strict check on keywords in obstypes parameter file. Corrected
      obstypes parameter file in example 1 (replaced MIN and MAX by MINVALUE and
      MAXVALUE). Removed redundant explicit call to das_setobstypes() in
      enkf_calc.c made in the case of singleob.
   -- Corrected handling of obs error from file in obs_add().
   -- Made a few changes towards achieving consistency in handling grid
      periodicity. Affected interpolate2d(), interpolate3d(), grid_xy2fij().
   -- Do not calculate transforms for a grid in das_calctransforms() if there
      are no model variable associated with it.
   -- Corrected das_updatefields() to work in the case STRIDE = 1.
v. 0.91
   PS 12122014
   -- Structural changes: no more `models' directory. Instead, grid
      specifications now require VTYPE (currently can be either "z" or "sigma").
v. 0.90
   PS 17122014
   -- Corrected defect in verticall mapping -- thanks to Russ Fiedler for the
      bug report.
   -- Moved `gridprm' stuff to gridprm.[ch].
v. 0.89
   PS 10122014
   -- Added sigma model to enable assimilating with ROMS. Quite substantial
      secondary changes overall.
v. 0.88
   PS 20141120
   -- SUBSTANTIAL structural changes. It is now possible to have multiple grids
      within a model. Each variable is associated with one of the grids. The
      ensemble transforms are calculated separately for each grid. Analysed
      ensembles in pointlogs are produced with the transforms on the grid
      defined first in the grid parameter file, for now.
   -- A correction for the CARS reader: an obs is considered invalid if its
      depth is < 0.
v. 0.87
   PS 20141114
   -- Replaced SRF limited inflation by inflation limited by directly calculated
      spread reduction for each element of the state vector. This is a default
      inflation mode; add PLAIN to the inflation specification in the parameter
      file to use uniform inflation.
v. 0.86
   PS 20141110
   -- The variable-specific inflation set in the model parameter file now simply
      overrides (not multiplies with) the common inflation set in the main
      parameter file.
v. 0.85
   PS 20141103
   -- Added RADS reader "biased" for MDT bias correction with the EnKF.
   -- Modified format of H_fn: added varname2 to specify for the bias variable
      when necessary.
   -- Corrected a minor interpolation bug introduced in previous version in
      das_updatefields().
   -- Corrected interpolation bug in fi2x().
v. 0.84
   PS 20141024
   -- in das_updatefields() limited inflation by 1 + SRF.
v. 0.83
   PS 20141013
   -- Added a new parameter "--no-superobing" to enkf_prep.
v. 0.82
   PS 20141010

      array element outside the array.
v. 0.81
   PS 20141008
   -- Modified das_calcbatchstats() to run only on master.
v. 0.80

      could be used.
v. 0.79
   PS 20140919 (minor changes)
   -- Made it possible to compile without `gridutils' by defining flag
      -DNO_GRIDUTILS
v. 0.78
   PS 20140919 (minor changes)
   -- Set batch ID for NAVO and Windsat SST obs to 0 (was -1). This makes it
      possible to identify "bad batches" of these obs on "per file" basis.
v. 0.77
   PS 20140909 (moderate structural changes)
   -- Introduced `struct variable'.
   -- Changed the way the custom model initialisation is done: now it is called
      right after reading the model type; this allows to read other bits in the
      model parameter file in a custom way.
   -- Removed now redundant `struct zmodelprm' in zmodel.c. Added
      zmodel_adddata().
   -- Now read WM__INST_TYPE in MMT reader as the instrument type.
   -- Removed redudant variable `vv' in das_updatefields().
   -- Modified definition of das_updatefields() to make it more general and
      more consistent with other update procedures.
v. 0.76
   PS 20140901
   -- Renamed stage 3 from "post" to "update".
v. 0.75
   PS 20140828
   -- Introduced field `alloctype' in `modeldata' to handle de-allocation.
   -- Made the parameter `nk' in
      model_getdims(model* m, int* ni, int* nj, int* nk) optional (can be NULL
      if not needed).
v. 0.74
   PS 28082014
   -- Moved specification of variables from main parameter file to model
      parameter file.
   -- Modified entry for model data: it now should start with "DATA".
v. 0.73
   PS 27082014
   -- Reduced number of tiles for point logs by joining tiles for the same
      field for all point logs into one.
v. 0.72
   PS 26082014
   -- Made writing state variables to point log files two-stage, similar
      to other updates: first to tiles, one cpu per tile, and then the final
      "assembly". Added plog_writestatevars_toassemble() and
      plog_assemblestatevars(); plog_writestatevars() became
      plog_writestatevars_direct().
v. 0.71
   PS 20082014
   -- Made structural changes: put observation type related stuff into
      obstypes.[ch]. Introduced new "observation types" parameter file.
      Eliminated `struct obstypedesc' and global variable `obstypedesc
      otdescs[]'. Consolidated all obs type related stuff in
      observations.obstypes field. Moved all obs types related stuff from
      enkfprm_read() to obstypes_read().
   -- Added descriptions of each parameter file used; modified usage to reflect
      this.
   -- Modified obs_add() to report the number of good obs read from each data
      file (along with the total number of obs). Removed this from CARS and
      MMT readers (no longer needed).
   -- In example 1 added a new target "singleob".
v. 0.70
   PS 18082014
   -- Fixed a silly defect in das_writefields_toassemble() (an unecessary cycle
      over ensemble).
v. 0.69
   PS 15082014
   -- Introduced obs_checkdatasize() and put it into readers.
v. 0.68
   PS 15082014
   -- Introduced option to specify domains for each type of observations by
      entries "OBSDOMAIN <obs type> <x1> <x2> <y1> <y2> [<z1> <z2>]" in the
      parameter file.
   -- For RADS reader in Neil White's format - only use obs with local_flag = 0.
v. 0.67
   PS 14082014
   -- Made a modification: the entries for standard deviations optionally
      specified in each section of the observation parameter file can now
      also specify the associated arithmetic operation: EQUAL (default),
      PLUS (actually sqrt(std * std + prev * prev)), MULT, MIN, MAX
v. 0.66
   PS 13082014
   -- Made a small correction in readers.
   -- Merged das_create() for calc and post. Added creation of pointlogs for
      post.
   -- Swapped dimensions for S in plog_write().
   -- Introduced field `struct observation.nallocated'.
v. 0.65
   PS 09082014
   -- Eliminated potentially architechture dependent operations with floating
      point in distribute_iterations().
v. 0.64
   PS 08082014
   -- Removed exit by error in distribute_iterations() in the case when the
      number of iterations is less than the number of CPUs. Seems to work fine.
   -- Replaced enkf_calc.c::int fstatsonly by global.c::int enkf_fstatsonly.
   -- Added a new target "stats" to example/1.
v. 0.63

      interpolate_2d_obs() ).
v. 0.58
   PS 04082014
   -- Rewrote unsortobs_byij() in an economical way, avoiding duplication of S.
v. 0.57
   PS 01082014
   -- Modified das_destandardise() to include restoring obs order by id.
      Simplified das_printobsstats(), das_printfobsstats(dasystem* das)
      and das_calcbatchstats() accordingly.

      grid cell after its fractional indices are written and read from
      observations.nc
v. 0.53
   PS 15072014
   -- Adding another parameter for entry BADBATCHES - threshold batch mean
      absolute innovation.
v. 0.52
   PS 14072014
   -- Setting SOBSTRIDE = 0 now switches superobing off.
v. 0.51
   PS 11072014 Added functionality to detect and remove bad batches of obs:

   -- Introduced a new option "--no-mean-update" for enkf_calc.
v. 0.38
   PS 27022014
   -- Reshuffle of writing the output by post: now by default it writes analysed

v. 0.37
   PS 21022014
   Bug fix: inflation was not applied properly when running with

v. 0.23
   PS 31/7/2013
   Changed return values for model_getmemberfnameasync_fn and
