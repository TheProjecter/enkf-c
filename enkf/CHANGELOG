   -- Added grid_setdepth(), grid_setnumlevels(), grid_getdepth(),
      grid_getnumlevels(), grid_getname().
   -- Split model setup  into `setgridfn' and `setupfn'.

v. 0.45
   PS 06062014
   -- Try to automatically detect whether the model grid's longitudes belong to
      [-180, 180] or [0, 360] range and adjust observations accordingly.
   -- Changed model->depth from double** to float**.
   -- Modified model_z2k(): it now checks that the observation depth is smaller
      than the model depth.
v. 0.44
   PS 19052014
   -- Added new scheme EnKF-N
   -- Filtered out (by default) obs outside model grid in obs readers now, not
      during writing obs to files.
v. 0.43
   PS 14052014
   -- Consolidated tiles for the EnKF in per variable/per layer files. That
      is, one tile now holds the whole ensemble. Fixed defects in detecting
      tiles. Removed WRITEBG_BYMASTER pre-processor flag.
v. 0.42

      to leave tiles
v. 0.41
   PS 16042014
   -- Modified writing spread to use tiles by default, and write directly to
      spread.nc when specified --direct-write.
v. 0.40
   PS 01042014
   -- Introduced new parameter SOBSTRIDE, 1 by default, to define the stride
      of superobing.
v. 0.39

      the value, but also: lon, lat, depth, fi, fj, fk, date
   -- Introduced a new option "--no-mean-update" for enkf_calc.
v. 0.38
   PS 27022014
   -- Reshuffle of writing the output by post: now by default it writes analysed
      2D fields to individual files, and then assemble those into final
      analysis files. Use --direct-write option to post to force the direct
      write
v. 0.37
   PS 21022014
   Bug fix: inflation was not applied properly when running with
   --out-increment in enkf_post.
v. 0.36
   PS 15022014
   -- Introduced a new command line option "--describe-prm-format"

v. 0.35
   PS 20122013
   -- Changed options style from "-x" to "--do-that".
   -- Removed utility "mkunitobs", introduced two new options for enkf_calc
      "--single-observation-xyz" and "--single-observation-ijk" instead.
   -- Replaced pre-processor flag SEPARATE_STORAGE by a new option for
      enkf_post "separate-output"
   -- Introduced a new option to enkf_post "output-increment".
   -- Introduced a new file global.c to store global flags and settings.
v. 0.34
   PS 17122013

      the z2k transformations in partially watered cell are assumed to be
      not valid.
   -- Introduced new type "obstypedesc", at this stage -- to contain
      information whether observations of this type are surface or subsurface.
   -- Added a new field "id_orig" to type "measurement".
   -- Changed MPI send/receive for HE from blocking to asynchronous to avoid a
      bottleneck for very large models.
   -- Added compile flag HE_VIAFILE to communicate HE via a NetCDF file.
v. 0.33
   PS 27112013
   -- Introduced ENSOBSTYPE for ensemble observations (was double), to save
      memory for very big systems.
v. 0.32
   PS 15112013
   -- Added reporting stats for individual instruments by das_printobsstats()
      and das_printfobsstats().

   PS 04112013
   -- Added SCHEME = ETKF (DEnKF remains the default) for MODE = EnKF.
   -- observations-orig.nc: excluding observations with status = STATUS_OUTSIDE;
      use "enkf_prep -a ..." to put all obs.
v. 0.30
   PS 18102013
   Added a pre-processor option SEPARATE_STORAGE to split forecast and analysis
   into diffeent files. The analysis file name is created by appending
   ".analysis" to the forecast file name.
v. 0.29
   PS 14102013
   Implemented point logs.
v. 0.28
   PS 26092013

   "spread.nc".
v. 0.27
   PS 12092013
   Added backtrace() in enkf_quit().
   Added a pre-processor option WRITEBG_BYMASTER to update BG fields by all
   processes or by master only.
v. 0.26
   Paul Sandery 4/9/2013
   Added reading profiles in BoM's MMT format.
v. 0.25
   PS 22/8/2013

   This cuts (for EnOI) reading the ensemble and calculating transforms.
v. 0.24
   PS 19/8/2013
   Modified das_writebg() to pass all writing to the master.
v. 0.23
   PS 31/7/2013
   Changed return values for model_getmemberfnameasync_fn and
   model_getbgfnameasync_fn from void to int. These functions are supposed
   to return 0 or 1 depending on whether the asynchronous data were found (1)
   or not (0).
   Modified writefield() to handle "missing_value" atribute for NC_FLOAT.
   Modified das_printobsstats() to print stats by day for asynchronous obs.
v. 0.22
   PS 11/7/2013
   Modified writefield() to handle "valid_range" attribute for data of type
   NC_FLOAT.
v. 0.21
   PS 5/7/2013
   Added curvilinear capability for MOM. Was not able to test.
v. 0.20
   PS 15/5/2013
   Added file headers
v. 0.18
   PS 10/5/2013

   PS 8/4/2013
   Fixed defect in distribute_iterations().

   PS 5/4/2013
   For all readers - handle the case of # obs. = 0.
