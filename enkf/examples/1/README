This is an example for the EnKF-C package. It has been put up based on the runs
of regional EnKF and EnOI reanalysis systems for Tasman Sea developed by Bureau
of Meterology. It allows one to conduct a single assimilation for 23 December 
2007 (day 6565 since 1 January 1990) with either EnKF or EnOI.

Note that to reduce the example size 
(1) the model state vector is stripped to two layers
(2) the horizontal grid has been reduced to 100 x 100
(3) global NAVO SST observations has been cut to regional observations only

PRE-REQUISITIVES:

1. To run this example you need to download example1-data.tar.gz from 

https://drive.google.com/folderview?id=0B-joqvlrlCeRMjBtUFpRRHR1M0E&usp=sharing

and unpack in this directory.

2. You need to compile EnKF-C and copy executables enkf_prep, enkf_calc and
 enkf_post to the directory of the example.

3. You may wish to adjust NP_CALC and NP_POST in Makefile according to the 
number of cores on your machine.

Testing EnKF:

To assimilate with the EnKF, run "make enkf".
The analysed ensemble members will be of the form 
ensemble_6565/mem<num>_<var>.nc.analysis, where <num> is the member id, between
001 and 096, and <var> is one of the state variables: eta_t, temp, salt, u or v.

Testing EnOI:

To assimilate with the EnOI, run "make enoi". The analysis will be of the form
background/bg_<var>.nc.analysis.

To clean up the analysis, run "make clean".

Apart from the EnKF/EnOI analyses, a number of auxiliary files are generated:

prep.out - log file from enkf_prep
calc.out - log file from enkf_calc
post.out - log file from enkf_post
observations.nc - pre-processed superobservations
observations-orig-nc - pre-processed original observations
enkf_diag.nc - observation impact file
X5.nc - 2D array of local ensemble tranforms (EnKF)
w.nc - 2D array of local ensemble linear combination coefficients (EnOI)
spread.nc - spread of the corresponding ensemble

If you suspect that something went wrong, you may compare your logs with those
in the "logs" directory.

Have fun,
Pavel Sakov
